# mille-swiftwasm

Mille is the web app for simulating the appearance of a hierarchy with widgets using an accent color.

On dashboards, widgets are a shortcut for making information blocks recognizable and are one effective means of increasing visibility.

This is powered by [Tokamak](https://github.com/TokamakUI/Tokamak) with [SwiftWasm](https://github.com/swiftwasm).

The macOS application of Mille is [here](https://github.com/Shakshi3104/Mille).
